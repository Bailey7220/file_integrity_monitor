# file_integrity_monitor
This File Integrity Monitor (FIM) is a Python tool that helps detect unauthorized or unexpected changes to files in a specified directory. It works by generating and storing cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) for each file, then comparing them on subsequent runs to identify modifications, additions, or deletions.
